# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. 
Differences:
Scope: Software engineering encompasses the entire software development process, including planning, design, testing, and maintenance, while traditional programming typically focuses on writing code to solve specific problems.
Methodology: Software engineering emphasizes the use of systematic and disciplined approaches to software development, such as Agile, Waterfall, or DevOps, while traditional programming may involve ad-hoc or informal coding practices.
Quality Assurance: Software engineering places a strong emphasis on quality assurance, including testing, debugging, and maintenance, to ensure the reliability and robustness of the software, whereas traditional programming may have a narrower focus on writing code without as much emphasis on comprehensive testing and maintenance.
Team Collaboration: Software engineering often involves collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, including developers, testers, project managers, and stakeholders, while traditional programming may be more individual-focused.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall is a more traditional approach to project management, involving a linear flow. Agile, on the other hand, embraces an iterative process. It involves rapid actions and great flexibility.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].

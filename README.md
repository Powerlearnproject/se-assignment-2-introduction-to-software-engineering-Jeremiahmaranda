# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. 
Differences:
Scope: Software engineering encompasses the entire software development process, including planning, design, testing, and maintenance, while traditional programming typically focuses on writing code to solve specific problems.
Methodology: Software engineering emphasizes the use of systematic and disciplined approaches to software development, such as Agile, Waterfall, or DevOps, while traditional programming may involve ad-hoc or informal coding practices.
Quality Assurance: Software engineering places a strong emphasis on quality assurance, including testing, debugging, and maintenance, to ensure the reliability and robustness of the software, whereas traditional programming may have a narrower focus on writing code without as much emphasis on comprehensive testing and maintenance.
Team Collaboration: Software engineering often involves collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, including developers, testers, project managers, and stakeholders, while traditional programming may be more individual-focused.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall is a more traditional approach to project management, involving a linear flow. Agile, on the other hand, embraces an iterative process. It involves rapid actions and great flexibility.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering?
Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system
process
1) Feasibility Study
2) Requirements elicitation
3) Requirements specification
4) Requirements for verification and validation
5) Requirements management
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.

Ease of Reading: Software becomes more readable as it's separated into specific functions handling distinct aspects of the overall functionality.
Simpler Testing: Testing is more straightforward and detailed when focusing on smaller, singular-function modules.
System Focus: Developers can concentrate on individual system parts without affecting the entire system, enhancing development efficiency.
Code Organization: Grouping similar functions into files and libraries makes finding specific code easier, streamlining development.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1) Unit testing is a software testing process for testing specific units, components, or software elements
2) Integration testing which is when different software components and modules are combined and tested as a group to make sure everything is ready for the next level.
3) System testing - This checks for a system’s compliance in accordance with the necessary given requirements.
4) Acceptance testing - What makes this level different from the rest is that it’s conducted by the user or customer since the goal is to find out if the requirements have been met on delivery of the final product.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
